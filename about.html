      <p>I'm an information security researcher. My primary research interests are software vulnerabilities, network protocols, and static analysis. I currently reside in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, a magical place where the temperature swings between -40°C and +40°C. This amuses me greatly. I will never move.</p>

      <p>My original plan was to pursue a PhD in Computer Science in the hopes of dedicating my life to teaching and research, but I got restless after starting my Master's degree. Being of a hacker mindset, I decided to look for and create other opportunities to both teach and research outside of academia.</p>

      <p>In 2010, two friends and I founded SkullSpace, Winnipeg's hackerspace. Since then it has grown to roughly sixty paid members, and currently leases an entire two thousand square foot floor of a downtown building. SkullSpace contains a classroom in which I've taught courses on Lua and C, a workshop on Wireshark and SSL, and given talks on CTFs and Forth. SkullSpace also provides tools and people to assist me in my research.</p>

      <p>In 2012, four friends and I founded BSides Winnipeg, the city's only technical information security conference. BSides Winnipeg was held three times on a biennial schedule (2013, 2015, 2017) before switching to an annual schedule and renaming itself to The Long Con in 2018.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 2013, I travelled to the University of California, Berkeley to teach a full-day workshop at Sharkfest on using Wireshark to troubleshoot SSL/TLS. People paid money for it, nobody asked for it back, and everyone returned after the lunch break, so I'm calling it a rousing success.</p>

      <p>At the end of 2013, my first child was born. I now travel only for job interviews and annual company meetings.</p>

      <p>In the fall of 2014, I returned to the Master's program with a different focus than before, and a life (wife, child, job) outside of academia to keep me balanced. As of August 2018, my thesis is written and I'm hoping to graduate in February 2019.</p>

      <p>At the start of 2015, I founded the Winnipeg chapter of Papers We Love, a sort of book club for academic papers. Several times a year we meet to listen to someone present an academic paper, and then discuss it.</p>

      <p>In the spring of 2015, my second child was born, making me want to travel even less than before.</p>

      <p>I think my personality is best summed up by the most memorable compliment I've ever received: "You're the most genuine person I've ever met." The point being that the speaker always knew exactly what to expect from me, usually as a result of me explicitly telling him. I enjoy talking, whether I'm doing it or someone else is, which usually results in everyone around me knowing what I'm thinking. Reactions vary. I like that.</p>

      <p>I've had a plush squirrel in my pocket my entire adult life. I just thought you should know that.</p>
